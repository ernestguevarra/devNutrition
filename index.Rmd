# Undernutrition, mortality, and famine oh my!

---

# Which undernutrition?

* Undernutrition - many forms, many manifestations

* When discussing, learning, and researching on the links of nutrition and development, important to distinguish the form/s of malnutrition used

.center[![](https://scalingupnutrition.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/JME-2020-twitter1.png)]

---

# Forms of undernutrition commonly linked to development

* childhood stunting - assessed using height-for-age z-score (HAZ) index

* childhood underweight - assessed using weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) index

* childhood, adolescent and adult micronutrients deficiency - this includes various forms of anaemia, vitamin A deficiency, folate deficiency, iodine deficiency

---

# Childhood stunting

* important to distinguish the terminology of **stunting** - *the process of growth faltering* - with the terminology of **stunted** - the *state of growth failure*

* a measure of chronic undernutrition measured by height-for-age z-score (HAZ) index

* often used as a target outcome measure or outcome of interest when discussing development processes

# Micronutrient deficiency

* deficiency in nutrients results from a medium-term process of diet inadequacy - both in quantity and quality

* the level of micronutrient deficiencies at a population level gives an indication of diet quality

* micronutrient deficiency often manifest sub-clinically; when physical signs manifest, condition is often already very severe

# Mortality

* 52.5% of all deaths in young children are attributable to undernutrition; 44.8% in deaths due to measles; 60.7% of deaths due to diarrhoea

* This is interesting from a development perspective given that the types of undernutrition that relates most to mortality (wasting and underweight) are not the measures commonly used in relation to development

* Current research, however, indicate that children who are both underweight and stunted are at greatest risk of death compared to other children

---

# Famines

* The most extreme manifestation of the breakdown of a society's food system that results in excess mortality and increase in incidence of acute wasting

* Acute episode of extreme hunger that results in excess mortality due to starvation or hunger-induced diseases

# Useful definitions?

### *“Most definitions merely provide ‘a pithy description’ of what happens during famines, rather than ‘helping us to do the diagnosis - the traditional function of a definition’.”*

#### Sen 1981

---

class: middle

### *“Famine is a socio-economic process which causes the accelerated destitution of the most vulnerable, marginal and least-powerful groups in a community, to a point where they can no longer, as a group, maintain a sustainable livelihood.  Ultimately, the process leads to the inability of the individual to acquire sufficient food to sustain life.”*

#### Walker, 1989

---

# Declaring a famine

### *“There is still a major controversy over whether the Ethiopia crisis of 1999-2000 should be labeled a 'famine' or not, in light of the emotive and political connotations of the word.  In the author’s view - given the number of people affected, the damage to livelihoods and human development, and the loss of human life - there is no question about whether Ethiopia 1999-2000 was a famine.  But the continued controversy over this issue points to the need for a broadly accepted operational definition of famine.”*

#### Maxwell, 2005

---

# Declaring a famine

* Highly politicised label

* When is a ‘famine’ declared and who decides?

* Incentives or disincentives to declare

* What are the information needs and how reliable are information sources?

---

# Food availability decline (FAD)

* Supply theory of famine

* Shortage of food 

* Assessed through estimation of 

    * Food production (+) 
    * Imports (+)
    * Exports (-)
    * Wastage (-)
    * grain needed for sowing (-)
    * residual stocks (+)

---

# Causes of FAD

* Drought or floods

* Diseases of plants or animals

* Declines in soil productivity

* Conflict

* Government policies (e.g. cash cropping)

* Regulations on land use

* Trade regulations

* Alternative use of agricultural production (e.g. Food as fuel)

---

# Food entitlement decline (FED)

* Demand theory of famine

* Failure to demand even when supply sufficient

* Types of entitlements (entitlement set):

    * Ownership
    * Exchange
    * Non-market 

* Relationship between non-food and food prices

* Famine may result form a change in the price of key items in the entitlement set

---

# Market failures

* Imperfect system of distribution

    * Infrastructure
    * Transport (ownership, repair, alternative uses)

* Physical fragmentation

    * Transaction costs & risks (physical isolation, imperfect information)

* Speculation and hoarding

    * Collusion of merchants to artificially limit supply in order to increase costs and profits
    
---

# Modern famines

* Complex combinations of many factors including FAD and FED and market failures

* Conflicts and/or sanctions

* Pandemic (?)

* Impact of development interventions is a mixed bag

* Complexity and fluidity of the on-the-ground situation often not matched by the modality and implementation of the interventions

* Scaling up of interventions to reach greatest coverage continue to be a problem even in non-crisis/famine situations and fails terribly in crisis situations

* Continuing tension between development and humanitarian interventions; between sustainable response or emergency response
